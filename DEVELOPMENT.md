# Checklist for development

- While developing comment out the 'image' key from 'config.yaml' to make the supervisor build the addon
  - Remember to put this back when pushing up your changes.
- When you merge to the 'main' branch of your repository a new build will be triggered.
  - Make sure you adjust the 'version' key in 'config.yaml' when you do that.
  - Make sure you update 'CHANGELOG.md' when you do that.
  - The first time this runs you might need to adjust the image configuration on github container registry to make it public
  - You may also need to adjust the github Actions configuration (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow > Read & Write)
